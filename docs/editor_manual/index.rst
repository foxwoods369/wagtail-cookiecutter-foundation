Using Wagtail: An Editor's Guide
=================================

`Wagtail <http://www.wagtail.io>`_ is a new open source content management system (CMS) developed by `Torchbox <http://www.torchbox.com>`_. It is built on the Django framework and designed to be super easy to use for both developers and editors.

This section of the documentation is written for the users of a Wagtail-powered site. That is, the content editors, moderators and administrators who will be running things on a day-to-day basis.

This documentation will explain how to:

-  navigate the main user interface of Wagtail
-  create pages of all different types
-  modify, save, publish and unpublish pages
-  how to set up users, and provide them with specific roles to create a publishing workflow
-  upload, edit and include images and documents
-  ... and more!
