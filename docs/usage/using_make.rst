Make file
==========

The easiest way to get started is to use the built in ``make`` commands. Your project contains a Makefile that allows you to setup your development environment with a single command. This command will create your project's virtual environment, install all pip dependencies,  create the development database, run migrations and load initial data to database, install front-end dependencies and finally start the development server for you. 

To do this run ::

	make all

You can access your site at ``http://localhost:8000``. The Admin back-end is available at ``http://localhost:8000/admin/``.The default Admin username is *admin* and The default Admin password is *admin123*.
